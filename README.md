# The Odin Project | Foundations | Landing Page
The objective for this project is to create a landing page for a website, using the design documents provided by The Odin Project

This project mainly applies all that I have been learning about CSS, with a focus on using Flexbox to position the elements, such as:
- Flex items and flex containers
- Positioning elements using Flexbox
- Using flex shorthand and how those 3 properties impact the positioning of elements on the page

There are certainly optimizations I could make - replacing the placeholder images, cleaning up the CSS to remove some redundances in the selectors - but overall I am happy with the way it turned out and am eager to move on to the next section.
